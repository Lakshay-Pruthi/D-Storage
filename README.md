# D-Storage
## About
This is a decentralized storage application that provides a secure and reliable way to store multimedia files such as images. The application utilizes the IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) network for storage, which ensures that your files are distributed across multiple nodes and remain safe even in the event of node failure or data loss.
